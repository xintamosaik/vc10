      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Outcome-oriented Web Developer with a strong focus on simplifying
        complex systems, enabling team alignment, and driving practical
        improvements — even in ambiguous, fast-moving environments. Experienced
        in modern TypeScript-based development, internal tooling, and migrating
        legacy systems toward maintainable, observable, and testable
        architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care about process, collaboration, and long-term value. Colleagues
        appreciate my initiative, low-ego mentoring, and ability to spot
        structural issues early — but I wait for readiness and co-shape change,
        rather than forcing it. Whether building template tooling that cut
        development loops from minutes to seconds or quietly replacing thousands
        of fragile lines with 60 that just work, I bring options — and make
        change easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now growing further into team-enabling roles through better listening,
        architecture clarity, and servant-leader practices.
